A web developer aiming to create innovative and user-friendly digital experiences. I recently graduated from FAST Islamabad with a BSc in Computer Science.

💻 My expertise lies in a range of programming languages, including C/C++, Java, Python, and Solidity. I enjoy solving complex problems and crafting efficient solutions.

🌐 I have hands-on experience with both MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and Flask frameworks, allowing me to build dynamic and responsive web applications. I'm passionate about leveraging the power of these frameworks to deliver seamless user experiences.

🗄️ Additionally, I have worked extensively with databases, particularly MySQL and MongoDB. With a strong understanding of data modeling and management, I ensure efficient storage and retrieval of information.

🔨 I believe in the power of code and its ability to bring ideas to life. By constantly exploring new technologies and honing my skills, I strive to create impactful web solutions that make a difference.
